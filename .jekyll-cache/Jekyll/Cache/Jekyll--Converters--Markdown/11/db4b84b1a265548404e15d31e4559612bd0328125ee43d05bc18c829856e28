I"k<p>Multi-robot task allocation with growing completion cost and simultaneity constraints</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Completion costs change predictably over time.</li>
  <li>Important to allocate agents to prevent tasks from growing so much that they become unsolvable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Identical homogeneous agents</li>
  <li>Tasks with growing completion costs can become difficult or impossible to complete later.</li>
  <li>Two famous methods for task allocation:
    <ul>
      <li>Threshold based method: agents individually assess the constraints and their ability to complete each task.</li>
      <li>Auction based method: market inspired auction methods typically require more communication and are more centralized.
Agent with largest bidding takes the task.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Proposed method strikes a balance between distribution and centralization.
    <ul>
      <li>Each agent is directed to an area by central authority, but upon reaching the destination, agents act on their own logic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Agent must be on a task’s location in order to apply work.</li>
  <li>More agents than tasks since multiple agents must be assigned to a task.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Task는 다음과 같이 정의되는 cost를 가지고 있다.

    <ul>
      <li>w: work per time unit per agent</li>
      <li>h: monotonically increasing function</li>
      <li>n: number of agents working on task i at time t</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If h(f) &gt; w x n, it means that the task is growing faster than the assigned agents can reduce it. Then, the task can never be completed.</li>
